# Build Requirements
I only compile this on UNIX like systems. You need the standard build tools
such as `autoconf`, `libtool`, and `flex` and `bison`. Also there is a runtime
requirement : `libobject` which you can get at https://github.com/libobject/libobject

# Virtual Machine
The compiler generates instructions of the custom instruction set (como_opcode.h) The virtual machine is stack based and only a few instructions take operands. Most instructions pop there arguments from the stack. Here is the relevant source code and instruction output generated from the compiler. This was run with the following command: `./como --print-asm test/for_loop`

```
for(i = 5; i >= 0; i--)
{
  if(i % 2 == 0) {
    print(i);
  }
}
```

# Problems
- There is no `continue`, or `break` statements in loops at this time. The first idea that comes to mind to implement this is to have the executor keep track if the VM is in a loop and store the correct JMP address. This is on the roadmap for 2017
